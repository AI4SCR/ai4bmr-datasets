## üß± Data Model

All datasets are represented in a **consistent format**, enabling the same code to work across different
datasets. After preparing and setting up the dataset instance, the following attributes are available:

- `images` ‚Äì Dictionary of image objects
- `panel` ‚Äì Imaging panel description (DataFrame), including a key `target`
- `masks` ‚Äì Dictionary of mask objects
- `metadata` ‚Äì Observation-level metadata (pandas DataFrame) including a key `label`
- `clinical` ‚Äì Clinical / Sample-level metadata (pandas DataFrame)
- `intensity` ‚Äì Object / Single-cell intensity features (DataFrame)
- `spatial` ‚Äì Object / Single-cell spatial features (DataFrame)

These components are enforced and standardized across datasets.

### Data Versions

A dataset can have different versions of images, masks, features, and metadata, allowing for flexibility in data
access.  
To load the data *as published*, use `{image,mask,metadata,feature}_version="published"`. Be aware that for most
datasets, this means the loaded data is not harmonized. You may encounter inconsistencies such as:

- objects present in the masks that are not listed in the metadata,
- images without matching annotations,
- or cells in the metadata with no corresponding segmentation.

To work with a cleaned and more consistent dataset, some datasets offer an `annotated` version. This version:

- has cleaned masks to include only objects found in both the segmentation and the metadata,
- only contains images that have corresponding metadata.

**Efficient Data Loading:** Images and masks are **lazily loaded** from disk to avoid unnecessary memory use. Tabular
data are stored in Parquet format for fast access.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.10
- R >= 4.4.1

To install R, please visit the [R project website](https://www.r-project.org/) and follow the installation instructions
for your operating system.
Alternatively, you can install R using conda.

### Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment to install the required dependencies.

#### Using `venv`

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package
pip install git+https://github.com/AI4SCR/ai4bmr-datasets.git
```

#### Using `conda`

```bash
# Create a conda environment
conda create -n ai4bmr-datasets python=3.12 -y
conda activate ai4bmr-datasets

# Install the package
pip install git+https://github.com/AI4SCR/ai4bmr-datasets.git
#conda install conda-forge::r-base  # optional, if R is not already installed
```

## üöÄ Quickstart

This section provides a brief guide to get started with the package.

> **Note on Memory Requirements**
>
> Please be aware that storing the datasets can consume a significant amount of memory. The approximate requirements are
> as follows:
> - **Keren2018:** ~10GB
> - **Jackson2020:** ~180GB
> - **Danenberg2022:** ~66GB
> - **Cords2024:** ~785GB

### 1. Initialize and Prepare a Dataset

First, import the desired dataset and initialize it. You can specify a `base_dir` to control where the data is stored.
If not provided, it defaults to `~/.cache/ai4bmr-datasets` or the path set in the `AI4BMR_DATASETS_DIR` environment
variable.
We recommend configuring the environment variables in a `.env` file for convenience.

```python
from ai4bmr_datasets import Keren2018
from pathlib import Path

# Define the base directory for storing the dataset
base_dir = None  # use defaults
base_dir = Path('path/to/data/')  # define your own path

# Initialize the dataset
dataset = Keren2018(base_dir=base_dir,
                  image_version="published",
                  mask_version="published",
                  feature_version="published",
                  load_intensity=True,
                  metadata_version="published",
                  load_metadata=True
                  )

# Download and preprocess the data. This only needs to be run once.
dataset.prepare_data()
```

### 2. Setup and Access Data

After preparing the data, use the `setup()` method to load the data. By setting `load_intensity` and `load_metadata` to
`True`, you can access cell-level features and clinical data. You can list the available data versions using 
`list_{image, mask, metadata, features}_versions()`.

```python
# List available data versions
dataset.list_image_versions()
dataset.list_mask_versions()
dataset.list_metadata_versions()
dataset.list_features_versions()

# Setup the dataset with a specific version and load features
dataset.setup()

# Access core components of the dataset
print("Sample IDs:", dataset.sample_ids)
print("Available images:", list(dataset.images.keys()))
print("Available masks:", list(dataset.masks.keys()))
```

### 3. Work with Image and Mask Objects

Image and mask objects are loaded lazily. The data is only loaded into memory when you access the `.data` attribute.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Get the first sample ID
sample_id = dataset.sample_ids[0]

# Access the image and mask data
img = dataset.images[sample_id].data
mask = dataset.masks[sample_id].data

print(f"Image shape for sample {sample_id}: {img.shape}")
print(f"Mask shape for sample {sample_id}: {mask.shape}")

panel = dataset.panel
idx = panel.target == 'ds_dna'

# Visualize the image and mask for the DNA channel
fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 5))
axs[0].imshow(img[idx].squeeze())
axs[1].imshow(mask > 0)
for ax, title in zip(axs, ['channel', 'masks']):
    ax.set_title(title)
    ax.set_axis_off()
ax.figure.tight_layout()
ax.figure.show()

```

### 4. Access Cell-Level Features and Metadata

Once loaded, you can directly access the dataframes for intensity, metadata, and clinical data.

```python
# Access the intensity matrix (cells x markers)
print("Intensity matrix shape:", dataset.intensity.shape)

# Access the metadata (cells x annotations)
print("Metadata shape:", dataset.metadata.shape)

# Access the clinical data (patients x annotations)
print("Clinical data shape:", dataset.clinical.shape)
```
