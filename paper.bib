	abstract = {Single-cell analyses have revealed extensive heterogeneity between and within human tumours1–4, but complex single-cell phenotypes and their spatial context are not at present reflected in the histological stratification that is the foundation of many clinical decisions. Here we use imaging mass cytometry5 to simultaneously quantify 35 biomarkers, resulting in 720 high-dimensional pathology images of tumour tissue from 352 patients with breast cancer, with long-term survival data available for 281 patients. Spatially resolved, single-cell analysis identified the phenotypes of tumour and stromal single cells, their organization and their heterogeneity, and enabled the cellular architecture of breast cancer tissue to be characterized on the basis of cellular composition and tissue organization. Our analysis reveals multicellular features of the tumour microenvironment and novel subgroups of breast cancer that are associated with distinct clinical outcomes. Thus, spatially resolved, single-cell analysis can characterize intratumour phenotypic heterogeneity in a disease-relevant manner, with the potential to inform patient-specific diagnosis.},

	abstract = {The immune system is critical in modulating cancer progression, but knowledge of immune composition, phenotype, and interactions with tumor is limited. We used multiplexed ion beam imaging by time-of-flight ({MIBI}-{TOF}) to simultaneously quantify in situ expression of 36 proteins covering identity, function, and immune regulation at sub-cellular resolution in 41 triple-negative breast cancer patients. Multi-step processing, including deep-learning-based segmentation, revealed variability in the composition of tumor-immune populations across individuals, reconciled by overall immune infiltration and enriched co-occurrence of immune subpopulations and checkpoint expression. Spatial enrichment analysis showed immune mixed and compartmentalized tumors, coinciding with expression of {PD}1, {PD}-L1, and {IDO} in a cell-type- and location-specific manner. Ordered immune structures along the tumor-immune border were associated with compartmentalization and linked to survival. These data demonstrate organization in the tumor-immune microenvironment that is structured in cellular composition, spatial arrangement, and regulatory-protein expression and provide a framework to apply multiplexed imaging to immune oncology. A combination of multiplexed imaging and machine learning reveals that spatial organization of immune phenotypes within triple-negative breast tumors is linked to survival.},

	abstract = {The functions of the tumor microenvironment ({TME}) are orchestrated by precise spatial organization of specialized cells, yet little is known about the multicellular structures that form within the {TME}. Here we systematically mapped {TME} structures in situ using imaging mass cytometry and multitiered spatial analysis of 693 breast tumors linked to genomic and clinical data. We identified ten recurrent {TME} structures that varied by vascular content, stromal quiescence versus activation, and leukocyte composition. These {TME} structures had distinct enrichment patterns among breast cancer subtypes, and some were associated with genomic profiles indicative of immune escape. Regulatory and dysfunctional T cells co-occurred in large ‘suppressed expansion’ structures. These structures were characterized by high cellular diversity, proliferating cells and enrichment for {BRCA}1 and {CASP}8 mutations and predicted poor outcome in estrogen-receptor-positive disease. The multicellular structures revealed here link conserved spatial organization to local {TME} function and could improve patient stratification.},

	abstract = {Despite advances in treatment, lung cancer survival rates remain low. A better understanding of the cellular heterogeneity and interplay of cancer-associated ﬁbroblasts ({CAFs}) within the tumor microenvironment will support the development of personalized therapies. We report a spatially resolved single-cell imaging mass cytometry ({IMC}) analysis of {CAFs} in a non-small cell lung cancer cohort of 1,070 patients. We identify four prognostic patient groups based on 11 {CAF} phenotypes with distinct spatial distributions and show that {CAFs} are independent prognostic factors for patient survival. The presence of tumor-like {CAFs} is strongly correlated with poor prognosis. In contrast, inﬂammatory {CAFs} and interferon-response {CAFs} are associated with inﬂamed tumor microenvironments and higher patient survival. High density of matrix {CAFs} is correlated with low immune inﬁltration and is negatively correlated with patient survival. In summary, our data identify phenotypic and spatial features of {CAFs} that are associated with patient outcome in {NSCLC}.},
